			<div class="text">
				<p>Bread and Roses is an online publication that explores the various and ever-changing relationships between art and labor. Labor is often thought of as work—especially physical work—but political theorists and artists have tried to expand the definition into something more deep and meaningful. Throughout history, the concept of labor has evolved in response to the social and technological advancements that have changed existing modes of production.</p>
				<!-- <p>The first piece, <em>Labour in a Single Shot</em>, is a project that Antje Ehmann and Harun Farocki started in 2011. They initiated video production workshops in 15 cities worldwide. The task of the workshops is to produce videos of 1 to 2 minutes in length, each taken in a single shot. The camera can be static, panning, or traveling—only cuts are not allowed. The subject of investigation is “Labour”: paid and unpaid, material and immaterial, rich in tradition or altogether new.</p> -->
